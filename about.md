### Hi, I'm Xiao

I'm a software engineer passionate about **Search**, **AI**, and **machine learning engineering**.

### What I Do

I build tools and systems that work at scale. My interests span:
- **Distributed systems** and **Search infrastructure** backend engineering
- **LLMs** and agentic AI frameworks
- **Go** and systems programming
- **Open source** contributions

Currently exploring how to make AI systems more practical and deployable.

### Background

I've worked on various projects ranging from Go microservices to AI frameworks. You can find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/XiaoConstantine).

### This Blog

I write about things I'm learning—primarily around AI engineering, search, and programming. Think of this as a learning journal that's publicly accessible.
